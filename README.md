20250216- Changed from the original codecademy template after learning to host the site using github pages. Worked on the header using flex to display the H1 and list elements in the nav element on one line and center them in the header element. Created two classes for left and right and added margins and padding to give them space from the edge of the page and added borders and hover colours to the li elements which I intend to link to other places in the webpage later. Embedded a font from google fonts into the head element of the HTML file (still not sure if I've done this properly but the font is present so I assume it worked). One issue I had was when I set the background colour of the header element originally, there were borders which were filled if I set the background colour of the body element. The solution was to set the default margin and padding of the body element to zero.
